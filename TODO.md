TODO
====

- Check the .zpk package produced by zfdeploy using Zend Server 6.3
  - Potentially also provide functionality for actually _pushing_ the package to Zend Server via the server API?
- Deploy an Apigility application produced by the Admin UI
- Check if the development mode is disabled in production for Apigility
- Write the tests
- Test the script in a Windows environment
